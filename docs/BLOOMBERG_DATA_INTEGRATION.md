## Bloomberg File Structure

### Standard Export Format

Bloomberg Excel exports follow a consistent structure across all financial statement sheets:

```
Row 0:  Company Name Header (e.g., "Tata Steel Ltd (TATA IN) - Adjusted")
Row 1:  Empty
Row 2:  Column Labels (e.g., "FY 2019", "FY 2020", "FY 2021", ...)
Row 3:  Fiscal Period End Dates (e.g., "03/31/2019", "03/31/2020", ...)
Row 4+: Data Rows
        Column A: Field Name (e.g., "Revenue", "Total Assets")
        Column B: Bloomberg Field Code (e.g., "SALES_REV_TURN", "BS_TOT_ASSET")
        Column C+: Numerical values for each period
```

### Example: Income Statement Structure

```
Row 0: Tata Steel Ltd (TATA IN) - Adjusted
Row 1: [empty]
Row 2: In Millions of INR except Per Share | [empty] | FY 2019 | FY 2020 | FY 2021 | ...
Row 3: 12 Months Ending                    | [empty] | 03/31/2019 | 03/31/2020 | 03/31/2021 | ...
Row 4: Revenue                              | SALES_REV_TURN | 1546918.4 | 1461060 | 1547192.8 | ...
Row 5: Gross Profit                         | GROSS_PROFIT   | 482156.8  | 321460  | 459318.2  | ...

## Advantages Over yfinance

### 1. **Historical Depth**

**Bloomberg:**
- Income Statement: 7 years
- Balance Sheet: 10 years
- Cash Flow: 9 years

**yfinance:**
- All statements: 4 years (limitation discovered during implementation)

**Impact:** Bloomberg provides **2.5x more historical data**, enabling:
- Better trend analysis
- More accurate growth rate calculations (5-year CAGR instead of 3-year)
- Satisfies assignment's "5 years of data" requirement with room to spare

### 2. **Forward Estimates**

**Bloomberg:**
- Analyst consensus estimates for FY2026 and FY2027
- Enables forward P/E, forward growth projections
- Professional-grade forecasting

**yfinance:**
- No forward estimates available
- Limited to historical data only

**Impact:** Enhances valuation models with growth projections

### 3. **Data Adjustments**

**Bloomberg:**
- "Adjusted" statements account for one-time items, discontinued operations
- "Standardized" format ensures consistency across periods
- Professional-grade data cleaning

**yfinance:**
- Basic GAAP/IFRS reported data
- Minimal adjustments

**Impact:** More accurate financial analysis

### 4. **Field Granularity**

**Bloomberg:**
- Detailed breakdowns (e.g., inventories split into raw materials, WIP, finished goods)
- 50-100 line items per statement
- Bloomberg field codes for precise identification

**yfinance:**
- Summarized line items
- 30-50 line items per statement

**Impact:** Richer analysis capabilities

### 5. **Data Freshness**

**Bloomberg:**
- Real-time when exported from terminal
- Includes latest fiscal year (FY2025 in our case)

**yfinance:**
- Typically 1-2 quarters behind
- Free tier has delay

**Impact:** More current financial picture

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Bloomberg Parser (✅ COMPLETE)

**File:** `tools/bloomberg_parser.py`

**Features:**
- ✅ Parse Income Statement
- ✅ Parse Balance Sheet
- ✅ Parse Cash Flow Statement
- ✅ Extract company name
- ✅ Handle multiple sheet name variations
- ✅ Convert to pandas DataFrame (compatible with existing workflow)
- ✅ Auto-detect Bloomberg files

**Key Functions:**
```python
# Main parsing function
parse_bloomberg_file(file_path: str) -> Dict

# Individual statement parsers
parser.parse_income_statement() -> pd.DataFrame
parser.parse_balance_sheet() -> pd.DataFrame
parser.parse_cash_flow() -> pd.DataFrame

# Auto-detection
detect_bloomberg_file(ticker: str) -> Optional[str]
```

### Phase 2: Data Collection Node Integration (⏳ PENDING)

**File:** `agents/nodes/data_collection.py`

**Changes Required:**
1. Check for Bloomberg file first (using `detect_bloomberg_file()`)
2. If found, use Bloomberg parser
3. If not found, fall back to yfinance
4. Track data source in state (`data_source: 'bloomberg'` or `'yfinance'`)

**Hybrid Logic:**
```python
# Pseudo-code
bloomberg_file = detect_bloomberg_file(ticker)

if bloomberg_file:
    # Use Bloomberg data
    bloomberg_data = parse_bloomberg_file(bloomberg_file)
    financial_statements = bloomberg_data['financial_statements']
    company_name = bloomberg_data['company_name']
    data_source = 'bloomberg'
    
    # Still use yfinance for stock prices, news (Bloomberg file doesn't have these)
    stock_prices = fetch_stock_prices_yfinance(ticker)
    news = fetch_news(ticker, company_name)
else:
    # Fall back to yfinance
    financial_statements = fetch_financial_statements_yfinance(ticker)
    company_name = fetch_company_info_yfinance(ticker)['company_name']
    data_source = 'yfinance'
```

### Phase 3: State Schema Updates (⏳ PENDING)

**File:** `agents/state.py`

**New Fields:**
```python
data_source: str  # 'bloomberg', 'yfinance', or 'hybrid'
data_source_details: Optional[Dict[str, str]]  # {'financial_statements': 'bloomberg', 'stock_prices': 'yfinance', ...}
```

### Phase 4: Report Annotations (⏳ PENDING)

**File:** `generators/word_generator.py`, `generators/excel_generator.py`

**Changes:**
- Add data source notation in Word report appendix
- Add data source label in Excel Summary sheet
- Example: "Data Source: Bloomberg Terminal (Financial Statements), yfinance (Stock Prices)"

### Phase 5: UI Enhancement (⏳ OPTIONAL)

**File:** `ui/app.py`

**Optional Features:**
- File upload widget for Bloomberg Excel files
- Data source selector (Bloomberg vs yfinance)
- Display data source used in results

---

## Usage Guide

### Manual Setup (Recommended for Assignment)

**Step 1: Place Bloomberg File**
```bash
# Option A: In project data directory
mkdir -p data/bloomberg
cp "~/Downloads/Tata Steel Ltd-FS,DVD,Price.xlsx" data/bloomberg/

# Option B: Leave in Downloads folder (auto-detected)
# System will automatically find files in ~/Downloads
```

**Step 2: Run Analysis**
```bash
# System will auto-detect Bloomberg file based on company name/ticker
python run_ui.py

# Or use command line
python -c "from agents import run_research_workflow; run_research_workflow('TATASTEEL', 'Tata Steel Ltd')"
```

**Step 3: Verify Data Source**
- Check Excel Summary sheet for "Data Source: Bloomberg Terminal"
- Check Word report Appendix for data source notation

### Test the Parser

```bash
# Test with your Tata Steel file
cd /Users/abelathur/MBA_BITS/Sem3/FM/Assignment
source venv/bin/activate
python tools/bloomberg_parser.py "~/Downloads/Tata Steel Ltd-FS,DVD,Price.xlsx"
```

Expected output:
```

      - Cash from Financing Activities
      - Acq of Fixed Prod Assets
      - Dividends Paid

✅ Parser test complete!
```

## Known Limitations

### 1. Stock Prices Not Included
- Bloomberg file contains `#N/A Requesting Data...` placeholder
- **Solution:** Continue using yfinance for stock prices (works perfectly)

### 2. Company-Specific Files
- Each Bloomberg export is for a single company
- Cannot batch-process multiple companies
- **Solution:** Hybrid system (Bloomberg when available, yfinance as fallback)

### 3. Manual Export Required
- Requires Bloomberg Terminal access to create export
- Not automated/API-based
- **Solution:** For assignment, manually export 1-2 companies to demonstrate capability

### 4. Field Name Variations
- Bloomberg uses different field names than yfinance
- Requires mapping/normalization
- **Solution:** Parser handles mapping automatically (see Field Mapping section)

### 5. Forward Estimates
- Includes analyst estimates (FY2026, FY2027)
- May want to exclude from historical analysis
- **Solution:** Parser filters by date, only uses historical periods

## Questions?

If you encounter issues or need clarification:

1. **Parser not detecting file?**
   - Check file name includes company name or ticker
   - Verify file is in one of the search locations (data/bloomberg/, ~/Downloads, .)
   - Try specifying full path explicitly

2. **Parsing errors?**
   - Verify Excel file structure matches Bloomberg export format
   - Check for manual edits to the file (parser expects unmodified exports)
   - Review error logs in console

3. **Field mapping issues?**
   - Check Field Mapping section above
   - Bloomberg field names may vary by export type
   - Contact for custom field mapping if needed

---

Bloomberg Terminal data integration provides **professional-grade financial data** with:
- ✅ 2.5x more historical depth (10 years vs 4 years)
- ✅ Higher accuracy (adjusted, standardized)
- ✅ Richer detail (more line items)
- ✅ Forward estimates (analyst projections)

The hybrid approach (Bloomberg for financial statements, yfinance for stock prices) delivers the **best of both worlds**:
